# Sample Prolog programs

These are example prolog programs found online. 

- `likes.pl` originally came from  http://clwww.essex.ac.uk/course/LG519/2-facts/index_18.html via SWI Prolog

The following come from https://github.com/Anniepoo/prolog-examples/. There is no license file associated with these:

- `adriandetective.pl`
- `birds.pl`
- `cuttutorial.pl`
- `dcg_examples.pl`
- `tictactoe.pl`
